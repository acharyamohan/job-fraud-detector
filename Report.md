Job Fraud Detector - Project Overview
1. Introduction
The Job Fraud Detector is an AI-powered web application built with Streamlit to help users identify potentially fraudulent job postings in their datasets. It leverages both rule-based heuristics and machine learning to analyze job data, highlight risky postings, and provide actionable insights via an interactive dashboard. The app is ideal for job seekers, recruiters, and data analysts aiming to enhance online job market safety.

2. Key Features
A. Rule-Based Fraud Detection
Uses a set of heuristics (keyword checks, suspicious patterns, missing info, etc.) to score each job for fraud risk.
Assigns a probability and risk level (High/Medium/Low) to every posting.
B. Machine Learning Model
Extracts features from job postings and allows training of a Random Forest classifier using rule-based labels.
The trained model can then be used to predict fraud risk on new, unseen job postings.
C. Interactive Dashboard
Visualizes results as pie charts (fraudulent vs. genuine), bar graphs (risk levels), histograms (fraud probability), and detailed tables.
Metrics for total jobs, number of fraudulent/genuine jobs, and high-risk postings.
Expanding detail panels for the most suspicious jobs.
Downloadable CSV reports.
D. Flexible Data Input
Upload your own CSV files.
Use built-in sample data for demonstration.
Enter a single job posting manually.
E. Model Export & Import
Download trained model and scaler for reuse.
Upload new test data and apply the trained model.
3. Project Workflow
User loads job data (by uploading, using sample, or manual entry).
System analyzes each posting using rule-based heuristics.
Results displayed in a dashboard: metrics, charts, tables, and risk details.
(Optional) Model Training: User trains a machine learning model (Random Forest) on the rule-based results.
(Optional) ML Prediction: User applies the trained model to new test data for advanced fraud detection.
Download results or model for further use.

Issues, feedback, and pull requests are welcome via GitHub.
Let me know if you want a deeper explanation of the code, specific workflow, or want this customized for your use case or organization!

you have not mention classification model being used
Thank you for pointing that out!
Yes, a classification model is used in your project. Here are the details:

üè∑Ô∏è Classification Model Used
Your project uses a Random Forest Classifier from scikit-learn as the machine learning model for fraud detection.

Where is it used?
When you choose to ‚ÄúTrain ML Model Using Rule-based Results,‚Äù the Random Forest classifier is trained on the features extracted from the job postings. The labels are the results of the rule-based detection (Fraudulent/Genuine).
When you pick ‚ÄúPredict on Test Data with Trained ML Model,‚Äù this model is loaded and used to classify new job data.
Code Snippet
Python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
RandomForestClassifier is a popular ensemble classification algorithm that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions for better accuracy.
Why a Classifier?
The problem is a binary classification task: each job is either ‚ÄúFraudulent‚Äù or ‚ÄúGenuine.‚Äù
Classification models like Random Forest are designed for such tasks, predicting discrete classes rather than continuous values (which would require regression).
Summary:
Your project uses a Random Forest Classifier for the machine learning-based job fraud detection stage.

If you want details on model hyperparameters, how to tune/evaluate it, or want to see how to swap in a different classifier, let me know!
